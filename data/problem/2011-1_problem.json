The Menominee Indians live in Wisconsin, USA. They number 5 000–10 000 people, but the epony- mous language of the Algonquian family is only spoken by a few dozen of the oldest among them, although effort has been put lately into expanding its teaching and use.\n“we_{1+2}” = ‘we and you’. æ ≈ a in crack, c = ch in church, q is a consonant (the so-called glottal stop). The mark “ ̄” denotes vowel length. —Ivan Derzhanski\n---",
