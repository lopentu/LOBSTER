Indicate the Latin word of the above list that never contained the dh sound. Explain your solution.\n\nAssignment 2. Consider six more Latin words:\n\n| Latin Word     | English Translation |\n|----------------|---------------------|\n| brevis         | short               |\n| gurdus         | silly               |\n| frīgus         | cold                |\n| unda           | wave                |\n| combrētum      | reed                |\n| dēbeo          | I owe               |\n\nWhich of these words are sure to have never contained the dh sound? Why?\nNote. Latin x is pronounced like English x as in ox ; the dash over vowels indicates that they are long.\n\n---",
