Alliteration (As stated in the problem):\n- The first line of each distich (pair of lines) contains two words beginning with the same sound, and the first word of the second line begins with this sound, too: e. g., rausnarsamr, rimmu and ríðviggs (III:3–4). All vowels are considered to alliterate with one another and with j: e. g., ók, ísarnleiki and Jarðar (I:1–2).\n3. Internal Rhyme:\n- Let V1, V2, ..., V6 represent the vowels in each line.\n- At least one consonant immediately following V5 must immediately follow Vn (n = 1, 2, or 3).\n- In even lines, Vn = V5.",
