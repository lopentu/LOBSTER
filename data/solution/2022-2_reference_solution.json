    "rules": "The structure changes based on whether the verb is stative or active, and whether it refers to a singular (\"1\") or plural (\"many\") subject/object.\nSuffixes:\n    Stative verbs end with the suffix -ka.\n    Action verbs end with the suffix -li.\nNumber Distinction:\n    For a singular entity (marked as \"1\"):\n        An infix is inserted into the verb root. The infix is either -ex- or -èe-.\n        In stative verbs, the full form is xéxx<infix>-ka.\n        In action verbs, the full form is xex<infix>-li.\n    For multiple entities (marked as \"many\"):\n        No infix is used.\n        In stative verbs, the full form is xèex-ka.\n        In action verbs, the full form is xex-li.\n\nPhonological Rules:\n1. The consonant l becomes identical to the consonant before it, but only when that consonant is one of the following: b, f, ł, or n.\n2. The consonant b becomes m when it occurs before any consonants.",
