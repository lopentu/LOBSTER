Plural forms are created by adding a class-specific suffix, sometimes with a preceding vowel a or o.\nClass -b:\nSingular: Ends in -b.\nPlural: Ends in -(a)bys.\nExamples: bø-bys (betel nuts), juhuru-bys (eggs).\nClass -h:\nSingular: Ends in -h.\nPlural: Ends in -(a)ruh.\nExample: ara-ruh (sugar canes).\nClass -g:\nSingular: Ends in -g.\nPlural: Ends in -(a)gas.\nExample: bai-gas (sheets of sago bark).\nClass -t:\nSingular: Ends in -t.\nPlural: Ends in -(o)gu.\nExample: nyba-t (the number 4).\n\n2. Number Construction\nThe counting system is based on addition, combining higher-value numbers (multiples of 6) with lower-value numbers (1-5).\nA.
